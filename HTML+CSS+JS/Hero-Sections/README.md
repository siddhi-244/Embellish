# What is a **Hero Section** ?
In Web Design, a hero section is the area that immediately shows up on the screen under your logo and menu. It should clearly state what your page is all about, a small but meaninful description and Call to Action links.

## About the Components

I've designed 2 Fully Responsive Hero Sections, right from scratch using HTML & Vanilla CSS. Components are designed mobile first.

They are ready to be integrated, and there's no tooling involved. All you need is the HTML & CSS files.


### Files and Folders

Here's what you need to know about the files and folders.

`css` - this folder contains 3 files:

1. `base.css` - It contains basic CSS resets and simple base design stuff that's common for both the hero components.
2. `hero1.css` - This is the CSS file for 1st hero component (for `hero1.html`).
3. `hero2.css` - This is the CSS file for 2nd hero component (`hero2.html`)

`images` - this folder contains all the images I've used in the components. You can obviously replace them if needed.

`hero1.html` - HTML for 1st hero component. Requires `base.css` & `hero1.css` to work.
`hero2.html` - HTML for 2nd hero component. Requires  `base.css` & `hero2.css` to work.
